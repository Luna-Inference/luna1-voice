```

### /api/v1/synthesise

* Method: POST
* Parameters: A JSON object denoting the text and (optional) speaker
* Response: `audio/ogg; codecs=opus` or `audio/raw`

example request body:
```json
{
    "text": "How can I help you? Is there anything wrong?",
    "audio_format": "opus"
}
```

The fields are as follows:
* text - Text for the TTS engine to synthesize
* audio_format - Format of the resulting audio. Valid options are:
   * `pcm` - 16bit Little Endian PCM audio of the model's native sample rate
   * `opus` - OGG stream with OPUS encoded audio. Always at 24000Hz

The following is the full structure of the request JSON (in C++).

```c++
struct ApiData
{
    std::string text;
    std::optional<float> length_scale;
    std::optional<float> noise_scale;
    std::optional<float> noise_w;
    // The returned audio format. Vaild values are "pcm" and "opus"
    std::optional<std::string> audio_formt;
};

```

example response:

```
<Some OGG/OPUS audio>
```

## WebSocket API

### /api/v1/stream

* Method: GET
* Parameters: None

This endpoint works exactly like the synthesise API above. But audio is streamed in chunk as soon as it can - reducing latency, as binary blobs. Message format is the same as the synthesise API body. A text message is sent once an error is encountered or synthesis of current text is finished.

For example, the following message causes OPUS audio to be streamed back as binray messages.

```bash
wscat -c 'ws://example.com:8848/api/v1/stream' 
> {"text": "Hello! how can I help you"}
< [OPUS audio blob]
< [OPUS audio blob]
< {"status":"ok", "message":"finished"}
```

The server will reply error as text

```bash
wscat -c 'ws://example.com:8848/api/v1/stream' 
> {"hello": "blablabla"}
< {"status":"failed", "message":"Missing 'text' field"}
```
